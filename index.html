      <h1 id="About-Me">About Me</h1>
      <p> I am an experienced legal professional seeking a first role in legal operations or legal engineering. I have extensive experience as a paralegal across a variety of areas such as
        ISDA negotiations, financial litigation, general corporate work, mergers and acquisitions and tax litigation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p> In the past, I have made extensive use of legal technology tools such as High Q, Relativity and LexisDraft. These certainly
        aleviate pain points for legal professionals and as a professional who is all too familiar the inefficiencies of legal practice - I want to be involved in tools which can transform the industry.
      </p>
      <br>
      <P> Away from work, I enjoy indie rock music. Which leads to me going to a lot of gigs, as well as walking and reading (usually about the latest corporate crimes to hit the headlines). Oh and of course
        enjoying learning how to code!</P>

      <p id="HTMLandCSSpara">In this project, I was given starter code which did not have semantic elements in the HTML and had accessiblity issues
        such as no alt attributes and so I addressed this issues in order to enhance the webpage accessibility and search engine optimisation.
