    <h1 id="About-Me">About Me</h1>
    <p> I am an experienced legal professional seeking a first role in legal operations or legal engineering. I have
      extensive experience as a paralegal across a variety of areas such as
      ISDA negotiations, financial litigation, general corporate work, mergers and acquisitions and tax litigation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> In the past, I have made extensive use of legal technology tools such as High Q, Relativity and LexisDraft.
      These certainly
      aleviate pain points for legal professionals and as a professional who is all too familiar the inefficiencies of
      legal practice - I want to be involved in tools which can transform the industry.
    </p>
    <br>
    <P> Away from work, I enjoy indie rock music. Which leads to me going to a lot of gigs, as well as walking and
      reading (usually about the latest corporate crimes to hit the headlines). Oh and of course
      enjoying learning how to code!</P>

      <p id="HTMLandCSSpara">In this project, I was given starter code which did not have semantic elements in the HTML
        and had accessiblity issues
        such as no alt attributes and so I addressed these issues in order to enhance the webpage accessibility and
        search engine optimisation.
