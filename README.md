# Portfolio

## About

I have made a responsive portfolio using CSS and HTML. It displays my name, a portrait photo, a section explaining my background and interests, 
and my project work. Additionally, it displays my contact details in the footer - including a hypelink directly to my Linkedin page.

There is a navigation bar outlining the above sections which when clicked smoothly scrolls down to the relevant section. 
At the time of writing, three of the projects are placeholders as I am at the start of my coding journey but I will add to this in time.

## Responsive Design

I have made the website responsive for use on a screen width of both 980px and 768px. To do this I have made extensive use of media queries,
as this was necessary to fit all elements of the website on a prospective user's screen. For example, I have made use of flex wrap on the 
"About Me" section at 768px width as this renders the page more aesthetically pleasing for the user at this resolution.
